# Conformal-LSTM-classifier-to-detect-anomalies
A **Conformal LSTM Classifier** combines **LSTM networks** with **conformal prediction** to detect anomalies in time-series data. The LSTM learns temporal patterns, and conformal prediction provides confidence scores. If the prediction confidence is low, the data point is flagged as an anomaly, making it useful for anomaly detection tasks.
